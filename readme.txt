The dimension of the car should be one pixel only.

The car should be present in the bottom most row of the arena.(5)

At any given point of the game there should be only 3 pixels available for the maneuvering of the car which should include 1 pixel of the car itself and the remaining 2 pixels either to the left or right of the car.(5)

These 3 pixels act as a path for the car to move and the participants should generate a path which should be continuous and random in nature and the path should fall vertically downwards.(20)

At all points of time all the remaining pixels should act as blockades/ obstacles. (5)

The four direction switches should be used to control the movement of the car.(5)

The participants need not accelerate the car.

As soon as the car goes out of the path, the message GAME OVER should be scrolled on the arena and then game should re start.(10)
